My hands on experience on firebase for the first time . 
This is just a practice project and has nothing to do with my internship .

This is my first time using Firebase.

## Files are :

- index.html — main HTML file  
- style.css — styles  
- auth.js — authentication logic  
- firebaseConfig.js — Firebase config  
- firestore.js — Firestore setup  

## To Setup

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `npm install`  
3. Open `index.html` in a browser
